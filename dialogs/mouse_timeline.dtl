mighty_mouse (default): Greetings, little fox
mighty_mouse (default): the heavy rain has caused a terrible cave-in within our cozy burrow, and we have lost our precious supply of cheese.
mighty_mouse (default): If you could guide us through the intricate maze to find our cheese, we would be ever so grateful.
mighty_mouse (default): In return, we shall help you find your dear father, and perhaps even call upon our city-dwelling mouse cousins for their assistance.
