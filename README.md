# TheTailOfTheFox
### My 2D game made it in Godot 
About the project:

This game is my first project, so it is as simple as possible. It is currently at an early stage of development, so it may seem crude, I wanted to create a game similar to a fairy tale book that will take the player back to childhood to fairy tales, to carefree times, or maybe you already have a child and you can play together and even have fun.

### About the game:

a simple 2D game where you have to help a little fox in his adventure [itch.io](https://dustvoyager.itch.io/the-tail-of-the-fox)
